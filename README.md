Our project is a mobile application that promotes exercise by encouraging corporate employees to complete fitness challenges and receive rewards based on their progress. Moosement will have features to create and customize a profile, view and log daily fitness challenges, join a team, view the department/company leaderboard, and register for rewards. We will be using VSCode as an IDE, Python + MongoDB for the backend, and Typescript + ReactNative on the frontend; for testing we'll be using mongomock as well as pytest. The frontend will manage a clean UI and client interactions, while the backend will handle database calls and interactions with the server, using a REST API library.
